## **Introduction**

The AWS Certified Developer – Associate (DVA-C01) exam is intended for individuals who perform a developer role. The exam validates a candidate’s ability to do the following:
-  Demonstrate an understanding of core AWS services, uses, and basic AWS architecture best practices
-  Demonstrate proficiency in developing, deploying, and debugging cloud-based applications by using AWS

## **Target candidate description**
The target candidate should have 1 or more years of hands-on experience developing and maintaining an AWS-based application.

### **Recommended general IT knowledge**
The target candidate should have the following:
-  In-depth knowledge of at least one high-level programming language
-  Understanding of application lifecycle management
-  The ability to write code for serverless applications
-  Understanding of the use of containers in the development process

### **Recommended AWS knowledge**
The target candidate should be able to do the following:
-  Use the AWS service APIs, CLI, and software development kits (SDKs) to write applications
-  Identify key features of AWS services
-  Understand the AWS shared responsibility model
-  Use a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to deploy applications on AWS
-  Use and interact with AWS services
-  Apply basic understanding of cloud-native applications to write code
-  Write code by using AWS security best practices (for example, use IAM roles instead of secret and access keys in the code)
-  Author, maintain, and debug code modules on AWS

## **What is considered out of scope for the target candidate?**

The following is a non-exhaustive list of related job tasks that the target candidate is not expected to be able to perform. These items are considered out of scope for the exam:
-  Design architectures (for example, distributed system, microservices)
-  Design and implement CI/CD pipelines
-  Administer IAM users and groups
-  Administer Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
-  Design AWS networking infrastructure (for example, Amazon VPC, AWS Direct Connect)
-  Understand compliance and licensing

For a detailed list of specific tools and technologies that might be covered on the exam, as well as lists of
in-scope and out-of-scope AWS services, refer to the Appendix.

## **Exam content**

### **Response types**
There are two types of questions on the exam:
-  Multiple choice: Has one correct response and three incorrect responses (distractors)
-  Multiple response: Has two or more correct responses out of five or more response options

Select one or more responses that best complete the statement or answer the question. Distractors, or incorrect answers, are response options that a candidate with incomplete knowledge or skill might choose.
Distractors are generally plausible responses that match the content area.

Unanswered questions are scored as incorrect; there is no penalty for guessing. The exam includes
50 questions that will affect your score.

### **Unscored content**
The exam includes 15 unscored questions that do not affect your score. AWS collects information about
candidate performance on these unscored questions to evaluate these questions for future use as scored
questions. These unscored questions are not identified on the exam.

### **Exam results**
The AWS Certified Developer – Associate (DVA-C01) exam is a pass or fail exam. The exam is scored against
a minimum standard established by AWS professionals who follow certification industry best practices and
guidelines.

Your results for the exam are reported as a scaled score of 100–1,000. The minimum passing score is 720.
Your score shows how you performed on the exam as a whole and whether you passed. Scaled scoring
models help equate scores across multiple exam forms that might have slightly different difficulty levels.

Your score report could contain a table of classifications of your performance at each section level. This
information is intended to provide general feedback about your exam performance. The exam uses a
compensatory scoring model, which means that you do not need to achieve a passing score in each
section. You need to pass only the overall exam.

Each section of the exam has a specific weighting, so some sections have more questions than other
sections have. The table contains general information that highlights your strengths and weaknesses. Use
caution when interpreting section-level feedback

### **Content outline**
This exam guide includes weightings, test domains, and objectives for the exam. It is not a comprehensive
listing of the content on the exam. However, additional context for each of the objectives is available to
help guide your preparation for the exam. The following table lists the main content domains and their
weightings. The table precedes the complete exam content outline,which includes the additional context.
The percentage in each domain represents only scored content.
